/* 	Ryuzine Writer Legacy OS Skins		

	This stylesheet loads the on-screen
	operating system elements such as the
	mobile device status bar, browser bar,
	tab/system bar and their typical sizes.
	
	You can over-ride any or all of these 
	with custom styles in your device skin.
	
	These are obsolete operating systems.
	Newer or current ones are in the main
	os.css file in /ryuzine/skins
