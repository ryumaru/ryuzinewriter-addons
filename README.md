# ryuzinewriter-addons
Add-Ons Pack for Ryuzine Writer

**THIS REPOSITORY IS MADE UP OF SUBTREES!** You should make changes to the repository for the specific add-on instead of editing files in this repository and then pull the commits from that repository into this one using:

*git subtree pull --prefix local_subfolder remote_repo_URL remote_branch_name --squash*

If you made changes to an add-on in a subfolder here and need to push those changes up to the add-on's repository use this:

*git subtree push --prefix local_subfolder remote_repo_URL remote_branch_name*
