iScroll is a multi-platform javascript scroller that adds mobile device-like scrolling regardless of the platform.

The “iScroll” script was created by Matteo Spinelli of Cubiq and was adapted for use in Ryuzine by K.M. Hansen.

the “iscroll” Add-On for Ryuzine simply loads that script and creates a control for enabling/disabling it in the Options Panel.

Because the “iScroll” project is quite actively developed you can easily install/replace the script within the Add-On by download iScroll from GitHub:

https://github.com/cubiq/iscroll/archive/master.zip

Unzip and drop the “iscroll-master” folder directly into the “iscroll” Add-On folder and it should just work.  If it doesn’t you may want to try an older release (originally used 5.0.6, last tested using 5.1.3)

Please note that the iScroll developers have no direct involvement with this Add-On or Ryuzine.  Direct any issues with it toward Ryu Maru.
